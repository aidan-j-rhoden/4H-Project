**Item Entered:** Custom Diffuser Top

**Description:** Have you been searching for evidence of a more awesome lid for your diffuser?  Don’t worry, a “smoking gun” has been found.
This custom lid was made from 100% [recycled PLA](https://www.amazon.com/Protopasta-Printer-Filament-1-75mm-Recycled/dp/B09SM62RB5/) filament.

## Print settings
With the above materiel, I used a 200C nozzle and a 50C bed.  However, I had some issues with the materiel prematurely heating, (causing failure-to-feed) so I removed the lid from the printer to provide better ventilation.  Maybe I could even have done without the heated bed.  It was sliced in Cura, with standard supports only touching the build plate.  Total print time was about 12.5 hours, with a 0.4mm extruder and 0.2mm layer height.
